# Academy Admin Scheduler

The Academy Admin Scheduler is a comprehensive scheduling and management tool designed specifically for academy or hagwon owners. A friend of mine grew their private tutoring business into a group-class style English academy for adults, so I made this for them. This Google Sheets-based system handles class scheduling, tuition calculations, attendance tracking, and payment management for educational businesses, offering administrators an all-in-one solution to streamline operations.
